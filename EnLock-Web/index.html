                <h3>Fast & Effective</h3>
                <p>Ageing hardware and difficulty of migrating control apps to a new platform (meant a total rebuild, reconfig, re-commissioning) but virtualisation of servers was chosen to improve availability and recoverability. There was doubt as to whether w2000k based server, real time controls, data-links / databases, HMIs, engineering and diagnostics would work properly. Advantage worked through these issues with us, trial runs were made on hot-spare systems, providing a fast and effective way of virtualising this.
